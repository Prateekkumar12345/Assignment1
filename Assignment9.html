            <h3>Abouts us</h3>
            <P>Education in India has its share of challenges. A large section of the population lives from paycheck to paycheck and hence does not have the funds for schooling. Instead of just getting a degree, people focus on upgrading their skills.

                Moreover, although schools and colleges are important, the skills they don’t teach us are just as useful. Hence, there exists an industry-academia gap in India’s education system. </P>
